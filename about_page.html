        In the game, you have up to three lives. Each time the ball hits the white area, you lose one life. To win the game, you need to clear the ball by dragging lines to create an area. When the ball enters this area and it turns white, the ball will be cleared. <br>
        As you progress through the game, the ball may move faster, and the arrangements of obstacles may become more challenging, requiring quicker reflexes and precision to clear the ball.
